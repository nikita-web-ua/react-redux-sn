# React-Redux Social Network

Developing a social network using React & Redux as a pet project. At first I developed my own redux store, understood how it works inside. Then I switched to Redux library which allowed me to understand some crucial architectural patterns of modern SPA. I got to know class, container and presentational components, their lifecycle, understood react hooks. Moreover, I integrated a TypeScript. Worked with third party REST API. Finally, I've tried lots of modern libraries.


**Created functionality**: user login form with validations, captcha, photo upload, edit, socket chat, comments, user search and filtering. Some testing with Jest.
